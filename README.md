## Features (of game-only demo)
- saves high score
- 4 attack types: Zephir's fire, arrow attack, orb attack, circle spell, + a blink skill
- camera follows mouse and zooms in/out with mouse wheel scroll
- player movement is relative to camera
- player faces center of the screen when turning left/right for ease of aiming, but blinks in the direction of movement input

### Known Issues/To-Do's
- emoji glow in built version is obnoxiously opaque
- need to update the game-only demo's ~~ugly~~ start screen art
- player has strange invulnerability frames when taking continuous damage from many mobs
- composing background music, will add ~~eventually~~ soon
